    Hi, I'm a Cyber Security Analyst born in Ä°stanbul. During my childhood I had the opportunity to have contact with technology by using PCs I built and that made me want to be in hacking field very early.  I made my first VPN and hacked Schools network to use schools Laptops how I want. After teachers heard this they called me every day to open blocked sites/apps that they can't access and with other thing I'd done I became famous in my school. That was the first enjoyment I had with hacking.
My Setup
My setup is actually a little complicated. I have a Macbook Air 8 Gb Ram 1 TB SSD with an M1 chip as my main Laptop. (I run Kali and ParrotSec as Virtual Machines on UTM because Virtualbox has issues with m1 chip to work on.)
I  also have a Windows 11 Desktop I built using Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060TI, Kingston 16GB Ram, Intel I5-13400F Cpu on Gigabyte H610M-S2H-DDR4 motherboard. I run Kali Linux, Windows 10 to see performance and capability differences from Mac.
On the other side I run Metasploitable linux on Virtualbox for my security researches.
I use GIT assisted with Git Bash for Windows. To learn more about my projects, visit my Github profile or the Projects page of this website.
